Hydra is a light-weight microservices library for NodeJS, which was announced at [EmpireNode 2016](http://empirenode.org/).

A key goal in Hydra is to make building Node-based microservices easy! 

If you're just getting started with Node Microservices and you have ExpressJS experience you should first look at our [HydraExpress](https://github.com/flywheelsports/fwsp-hydra-express) project.

Whether you choose to build an ExpressJS based application or opt for a strictly Node based one, you may want to checkout our [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/flywheelsports/generator-fwsp-hydra) for quickly building either project!
