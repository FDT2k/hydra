Hydra is a a light-weight library for building distributed computing applications such as microservices. It was announced at [EmpireNode 2016](http://empirenode.org/).

A key goal in Hydra is to simplify building Node-based distributed applications.

> Hydra replies on an instance of Redis, if you need to learn more about Redis, see our [Redis quick start guide](https://youtu.be/eX7EamF_WuA).

If you're just getting started with Node Microservices and you have ExpressJS experience you should first look at our [HydraExpress](https://github.com/flywheelsports/fwsp-hydra-express) project.

Whether you choose to build an ExpressJS based application or opt for a strictly Node based one, you may want to checkout our [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/flywheelsports/generator-fwsp-hydra) for quickly building either project! In fact you can do this in under 15 seconds. See this [animated gif](microservice.gif).
